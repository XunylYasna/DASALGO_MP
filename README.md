Mailman Delivery Simulation Program

The mailman is tasked to deliver all the mails from the post offices to the schools. 

The mailman must go to a post office to retrieve the mails to be delivered to a destination within the area. The mails must be arranged based on their destination. The route to be taken must also be well planned.

The destination of the mail can also be within the area of the another post office. In that case, the mailman must finish the deliveries in the current area first. Then, drop by the other post office where they can get additional mails to be added in their bag. The mailman will then arrange the mails again and plan the route to take.
